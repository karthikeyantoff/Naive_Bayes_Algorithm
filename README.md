# Naive_Bayes

Naive_Bayes
🩺 Medical Disease Prediction using Naive Bayes

A Machine Learning web application that predicts the likelihood of a disease based on medical input features such as age, gender, and symptoms.
The model is built using the Naive Bayes algorithm and deployed using Streamlit.

📌 About the Project

This project uses a Naive Bayes classification model trained on a medical dataset to predict disease outcomes based on patient information.

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that applies Bayes’ Theorem with the assumption of feature independence, making it efficient and well-suited for medical classification problems.

The Streamlit application provides a simple and interactive interface for users to enter medical details and instantly view prediction results.

The project is deployed on Streamlit Cloud.
